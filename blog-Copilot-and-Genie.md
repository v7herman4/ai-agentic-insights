**_An Agentic Azure Databricks Genie_**

Accessing data used to mean wrestling with BI tools, submitting service tickets, or decoding complex dashboards. Business users were often stuck waiting at the “data help desk,” slowing down decision-making and innovation.

But with **AI agents**, **Copilot Studio**, and the **Azure Databricks Genie**, we’ve flipped that script—putting data directly into the hands of business users through simple, natural conversations.

**From Bottlenecks to Breakthroughs: Empowering Business Users with AI**

Imagine your team exploring rich datasets in Azure Databricks using everyday language—no SQL, no dashboard drilling—just a conversation.

That’s the experience we designed with our **Copilot Studio Agent**, and it’s already transforming how business users engage with data. This post kicks off our _AI Agentics Insights_ series, where we spotlight tools and innovations that make data more accessible and actionable for everyone.

**🤖 What Are AI Agentics—and Why Do They Matter?**

AI Agentics aren’t just chatbots—they’re intelligent, context-aware assistants that reason, respond, and adapt. Think of them as the next-gen data analyst: always available, lightning-fast, and never burned out by spreadsheets.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Knows your **business context**
- Retrieves **trusted data** from secure sources

**Benefits to Your Organization:**

**🧞‍♂️ Meet the Azure Databricks Genie Agent**

We built a seamless integration in **Copilot Studio** that enables a natural language interface to Azure Databricks via the **Genie API**. Users can interact directly within **Microsoft Teams**, making it easier than ever to get insights where they’re already collaborating.

With the Genie Agent, users can:

- Ask data questions in plain English

We started with a prototype and quickly scaled it into a production-ready solution. The Genie Agent interprets intent, queries Databricks securely, and delivers contextual answers—instantly.

We're releasing a sample AI Agent on **GitHub** today that you can tailor to your own Azure Databricks Genie environment and surface directly in Microsoft Teams.

Imagine typing:  
🗣 _“What are our top five products by revenue?”_  
… and getting a clear, actionable answer in seconds—no tickets, no dashboards, just results.
